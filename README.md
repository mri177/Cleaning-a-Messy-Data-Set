# 🍷 Wine Dataset Analysis and Cleaning

This project focuses on analyzing and cleaning a dataset containing information on over **12,700 wines**. The dataset, provided as part of a data science course assignment, contains various data integrity and usability issues that must be resolved to prepare it for meaningful analysis and potential machine learning applications.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: Provided for Module 3 Assignment (DAV 6150 – Data Science)
- **Format**: CSV  
- **File**: `M3_Data.csv`
- **Rows**: 12,700+  
- **Attributes**: Wine-related features such as:
  - Variety
  - Country
  - Province
  - Taster details
  - Points
  - Price
  - Description (Text)

---

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Load and inspect the wine dataset using Pandas  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand structure and distributions  
- Identify and handle data issues:
  - Missing values  
  - Duplicate entries  
  - Outliers and invalid values  
- Clean the data to improve overall quality and usability  
- Transform the dataset (if needed) for future machine learning tasks

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for data visualization  

---

## 📈 Summary

- Comprehensive EDA was performed to explore feature distributions and relationships  
- Missing values were analyzed and appropriately handled  
- Duplicates and extreme outliers were removed or treated  
- Resulting dataset is clean and ready for future analysis or model development  

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Several attributes like price and points had missing or skewed values  
- Visualizations helped uncover geographic trends and rating biases  
- Data cleaning significantly improved the integrity of the dataset

---

## 📚 Future Enhancements

- Apply natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the wine descriptions  
- Build predictive models (e.g., price or rating prediction)  
- Visualize geographic wine trends using maps (GeoPandas or Plotly)
